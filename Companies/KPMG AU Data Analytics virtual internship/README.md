## Sprocket Central Pty Ltd , a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organisation.
it is keen to learn more about KPMG’s expertise in its Analytics, Information & Modelling team. 
Primarily, Sprocket Central Pty Ltd needs help with its customer and transactions data. The organisation has a large dataset relating to its customers, but their team is unsure how to effectively analyse it to help optimise its marketing strategy. 

## my task is to start the preliminary data exploration and identify ways to improve the quality of Sprocket Central Pty Ltd’s data.

  ### Break Down:
  #### Data Acquisition:
      The client provided KPMG with 3 datasets:  
        1-Customer Demographic.  
        2-Customer Addresses.  
        3-Transactions data in the past 3 months.  
  #### Data Preparation: utilized excel to do the next:  
      1- Data Cleaning: This involves removing missing values, formatting data types, standardizing data values, and removing redundant columns.  
      2- Data Transformation: This includes converting certain fields to appropriate data types such as numbers or dates.  
      3- Data Reduction: This is done by removing unnecessary columns from the datasets.  
      4- Data Discretization: This is implied when the author suggests unifying different forms of data, such as male/female in the gender field and different     
      abbreviations of state names in the state field.
